    <h1><u>Animations</u></h1>
    <p> Based off of the reading I was able to get a much more clear understanding on how to achieve some pretty neat animations. Some of the things which was used in the graph that was presented to us were d3.scale.ordinal and what this does is make the bars look more clear and have much more spacing from one another. However the main bulk of it all has to be the .transition(). This has to be placed above your attributes in the d3 algorithm. You used this in order to get your data to be represented differently. Within the transitions theres also many more things which you are able to control such as the duration, ease and the delay. .duration() allows you to have control over the transition time. The time is in milliseconds which is important to keep in mind. .ease() allows you to specify which kind of motion you want the data to take. Lastly, .delay() lets you have control over the time for the trasnition to actually begin and again this is in milliseconds. Theres two steps that go into making your visualization interactive. 1 is binding the event listener and 2 is defining the behavior which you want it to take. Another thing which you did to achieve the animation was used tooltips. Tooltips are quite neat and make your graph even more interactive. Theres 3 different tooltips discussed in the reading. Default browser tooltips, SVG element tooltips and HTML div tooltips. If I recall the tooltip used in the graph that was presented was a HTML div tooltips. The reason this one was used is because with default browser tooltips and SVG element tooltips you are much more limited to what you can present with it. In the other hand with the HTML div tooltip you still use d3 for the on click affect but you also create divs in your HTML as well as use css to achieve full visual affects that you want similar to how what you presented. </p>
